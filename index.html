        Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the seventh and final novel of the 
        main Harry Potter series. It was released on 14 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by 
        Bloomsbury Publishing, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books. The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood 
        Prince (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.
        Deathly Hallows shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the Harry Potter series. It holds the Guinness World Record for most novels sold within 24 hours of release,
        with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK.[1][2] Generally well received by critics, the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it the "Best Book for Young Adults". 
        A film adaptation of the novel was released in two parts: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 1 in November 2010 and Part 2 in July 2011.
